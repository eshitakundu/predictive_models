Classifier Comparison (Work In Progress)

This repository contains a basic comparison of four popular machine learning classifiers: Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, and K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier. The goal is to evaluate and compare the performance of these classifiers on a sample dataset.
